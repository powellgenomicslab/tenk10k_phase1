# CellBender for ambient RNA detection

We run CellBender ([paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01943-7), [docs](https://cellbender.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)) to detect the levels of ambient RNA present in our droplets, and to estimate empty vs non-empty droplets.

We consider default parameters except for a decreased ```learning rate``` value.
