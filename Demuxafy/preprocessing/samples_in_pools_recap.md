## Libraries sequencing recap

Just to keep a record of which sequencing libraries were sequenced when, re-sequences of batches, and split between TOB and BioHEART.

### 13 / 10 / 2023   

libraries sequenced on Oct 13th, 2023 (hence the name 231013)

Samples recap: all TOB, 64 libraries in total:

* Pools sequenced from S0016 to S0037 + 3 maxi pools (S0021-24, S0025-28, S0030-33)
  * All single pools are sequenced three times, e.g., S0018a, S0018b, S0018c
  * missing here are S0016a, S0017a, S0019a, S0027a, S0037b and S0037c 
  * S0029 is missing completely (was skipped when pooling)
* All maxi pools are sequenced twice, e.g., S0021-24a, S0021-24b

### 13 / 12 / 2023     

Samples recap: all TOB, 24 libraries in total:
