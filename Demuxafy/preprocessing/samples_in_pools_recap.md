## Libraries sequencing recap

Just to keep a record of which sequencing libraries were sequenced when, re-sequences of batches, and split between TOB and BioHEART.

### 13 / 10 / 2023   

libraries sequenced on Oct 13th, 2023 (hence the name 231013)

Samples recap: all TOB, 64 libraries in total:

* Pools sequenced from S0016 to S0037 + 3 maxi pools (S0021-24, S0025-28, S0030-33)
  * All single pools are sequenced three times, e.g., S0018a, S0018b, S0018c
  * missing here are S0016a, S0017a, S0019a, S0027a, S0037b and S0037c 
  * S0029 is missing completely (was skipped when pooling)
* All maxi pools are sequenced twice, e.g., S0021-24a, S0021-24b

### 13 / 12 / 2023     

Samples recap: all TOB, 24 libraries in total:

* Pools sequenced from S0001 to S0008 
* All single pools are sequenced three times, e.g., S0008a, S0008b, S0008c
* No maxi pools are included

### 14 / 12 / 2023     

Samples recap: mix of TOB and BioHEART, 41 libraries in total:

#### TOB (24 libraries):

* Pools sequenced 
  * S0009 to S0014
  * S0038 and S0039
  * 1 maxi pool (S0034-37)
* All single pools are sequenced three times, e.g., S0010a, S0010b, S0010c
  * except S0038 is sequenced four times (S0038a, S0038b, S0038c, S0038d) 
  * missing here are S0014b, S0014c, S0039c 
* The maxi pools is sequenced twice, i.e., S0034-37a, S0034-37b

#### BioHEART (17 libraries and pools):

* Pools sequenced:
  * S0045 to S0053
  * S0060 to S0067
* All pools are sequenced just once

### 15 / 01 / 2024   

Samples recap: mix of TOB and BioHEART, 25 libraries in total:

#### TOB (8 libraries):

* Pools sequenced: 
  * entirety of S0015 (S0015a, S0015b, S0015c)
  * previously missing sequences of S0014 (S0014b, S0014c), S0016 (S0016a) and S0037 (S0037b, S0037c)

#### BioHEART (17 libraries and pools):

* Pools sequenced:
  * S0040 to S0044
  * S0054 to S0056 (+ one maxi pool of S0058+S0059 together)
  * S0135
  * S0138 and S00139
  * S0141 to S0145
* All pools are sequenced just once

### 16 / 01 / 2024

Samples recap: BioHEART only, 17 libraries in total:

* Pools sequenced:
  * S0068 to S0084

### 19 / 01 / 2024

no web summaries, do this some other way

### 14 / 02 / 2024

Samples recap: BioHEART only, 16 libraries in total:

* Individual pools sequenced:  
  * S0102
  * S0104
  * S0146
  * S0148 to S0153
* Repeat sequencing of [old multiome pools](https://github.com/powellgenomicslab/tenk10k_phase1/blob/main/Demuxafy/preprocessing/BioHEART_make_pool_sample_lists.R#L198-L200):
  * S0056a, S0056b
