# Figure 2

Figure 2 of our [TenK10K phase 1 manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ck13c1NWXLolvEuvh-y3a11jsYbBfZOv1aU01U4o8FE/edit#heading=h.ds9fvb3nfr68) aims to summarise the sc-eQTL discovery across all 28 cell types.
Here, we include scripts and notebooks to generate all plots included in the main figure and all accompanying supplementary figures.

## Main figure

* Manhattan plots for all cell types, coloured by cell type, common variants
* Manhattan plots for all cell types, coloured by cell type, rare variants
* QQ plots coloured by cell type (incl permutations)
* effect size (beta) by frequency
* common variant eQTL count up, by location wrt eGene

## Supplementary figures

* All Manhattan plots, one per cell type, common variants
* All Manhattan plots, one per cell type, rare variants
* Number of eGenes by number of cells available for every cell type, common + rare variants
