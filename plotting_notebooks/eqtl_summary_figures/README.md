# Figure 2

Figure 2 of our [TenK10K phase 1 manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ck13c1NWXLolvEuvh-y3a11jsYbBfZOv1aU01U4o8FE/edit#heading=h.ds9fvb3nfr68) aims to summarise the sc-eQTL discovery across all 28 cell types.

Here, we include scripts and notebooks to generate all plots included in the main figure and all accompanying supplementary figures.

In some cases, we refer to other papers as templates for some of the panels, e.g., the [OneK1K paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf3041) [1].
