# Figure 1

Figure 1 of our [TenK10K phase 1 manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ck13c1NWXLolvEuvh-y3a11jsYbBfZOv1aU01U4o8FE/edit#heading=h.ds9fvb3nfr68) aims to summarise the data, including the scRNA-seq data from ~5 million cells across all ~2,000 individuals.

Here, we include scripts and notebooks to generate all plots included in the main figure and all accompanying supplementary figures.

In some cases, we refer to other papers as templates for some of the panels, e.g., the [OneK1K paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf3041) [1].

## Main figures

* UMAP plot of all data coloured by cell type 
* barplot of number of cells per cell type coloured by cell type
* barplot of number of cells per cell type coloured by cell type (log 10 scale)
* violin plots of number of cells per individual by cell type coloured by cell type
* histogram of number of cells per individual (across all cell types)

## Supplementary figures

* UMAP plot of all data coloured by various metrics
  * number of genes
  * total counts
  * % ambient
  * % MT
* QC metrics by cell type (violin plots coloured and grouped by cell type)
  * number of genes
  * total counts
  * % ambient
  * % MT
